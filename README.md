# Abstract of Article
Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), active and/or passive, can be densely deployed in complex environments to significantly enhance wireless network coverage for both wireless information transfer (WIT) and wireless power transfer (WPT). In this letter, we study the downlink WIT/WPT from a multi-antenna base station to a single-antenna user over a multi-active/passive IRS (AIRS/PIRS)-enabled wireless link. In particular, we derive the location of the AIRS with those of the other PIRSs being fixed to maximize the received signalto-noise ratio (SNR) and signal power at the user in the cases of WIT and WPT, respectively. The derived solutions reveal that the optimal AIRS deployment is generally different for WIT versus WPT due to the different roles of AIRS-induced amplification noise. Furthermore, both analytical and numerical results are provided to show the conditions under which the proposed AIRS deployment strategy yields superior performance to other baseline deployment strategies as well as the conventional all-PIRS enabled WIT/WPT.
